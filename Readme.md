Many features of PDFKit are presented in this application. Ostensibly the application allows you to open PDF's and edit existing Link annotations or create your own.  The code itself demonstrates two different means of searching a PDF. It presents an NSToolbar to control various aspects of PDF display and navigation. It subclasses PDFView to allow custom drawing and interaction. It makes heavy use of the PDFAnnotationLink class. It demonstrates the loading and saving of PDF's with PDFKit.
